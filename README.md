## 🤓 Project Overview ##

**What is the problem?**

In 2020, Singapore accumulated 665,000 tonnes of food waste, where half of an average waste disposal comprises food wastage in a household (NEA, 2021). Furthermore, $342 million worth of food waste is generated by Singaporean households every year (LIU, 2020). By looking at the contributory factors as to why excessive food waste is generated, we found out that a portion of food wastage comes from unopened items that have been disposed of after households forget about them. Additionally, during this pandemic period, households have been seen to adopt the tendency to over-purchase their groceries which results in more food wastage (Tan, 2020).

<br>

**How do we solve it?**

Introducing, Food-Ful, designed for anyone in the ages between 20-40 years old who are keen on reducing their food wastage. Our team has come up with a web application that aims to reduce food wastage - some features are for users to track the expiry date, and recommending recipes based on their inventory.

**Before Implementation**

Before the coding process, we came up with rough Figma design prototypes and a Web Navigation Diagram to give us a better idea on how our application will work.
<br><br>

**Below is our navigation diagram where we show the different functions and pages of our web application:**

<br><br>
**Below is our Architecture diagram to show the interactions between our application components:**
